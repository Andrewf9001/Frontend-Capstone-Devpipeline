          For the capstone project, I created a simple dashboard with a built in
          weather widget for the side navbar that accepts a zip code and will
          display the current weather. Within the dashboard section is the
          different widget components I have built out. During this project
          there was a lot I learned a big one was routing and how to route to a
          specific item view, still have issues in some areas such as login but
          in time and practice will come understanding. (In progress...)
